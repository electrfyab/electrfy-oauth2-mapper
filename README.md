# custom-oauth2-mapper
This project provides a sample of custom mapper of OAuth 2.0 external user into ThingsBoard internal user object.

You can use this application as a base implementation for the Custom Mapper endpoint.
As well, you can copy any snippet of this implementation into already existent your microservices.

You can combine this Custom Mapper with [ThingsBoard REST API Client](https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/rest-client/) to get any additional information from the ThingsBoard platform as Tenant Id or Customer Id.
